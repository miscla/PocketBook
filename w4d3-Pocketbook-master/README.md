# Project Week 4 Day 3 - Pocketbook

## Objectives

Pocketbook needs a sign up page for their mobile payment service. Here's what it [looks like](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/pocketbook/index.html).

#### Step 0

First, log in to [CODEPEN](http://codepen.io/) or sign up if haven't before. 

After you log in, click +New Pen button. 

Change the title to Pocketbook and then copy all the text in *index.html* and *style.css* to HTML and CSS section respectively in CODEPEN. 

Now you will work on CODEPEN, and don't forget to save.

#### Step 1

In the `header`, add [the logo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/pocketbook/logo.svg) and a bottom border.

#### Step 2

In the `main` section, add a row with one column. Add text for the heading and a form.

Read how to use [Bootstrap's form component](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms), and add fields for `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, `Password`, and a `Create account` button. Use CSS to style the form fields' borders.

#### Step 3

In the `footer`, add text for the three items and a top border. Display the items on one line.

#### Step 4

Change the background image of the body. Feel free to use your own image. [Here's the one](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/pocketbook/bg.jpg) we used.
